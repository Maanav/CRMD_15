Perhaps one of Bandra's most anticipated events, The "Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial 

Debate" , is back with a bang in its 17th year, hosted by one of Mumbai's finest technical 

institutions, Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering.  

Inaugurated in the year 1999, the competition in its initial years served as a podium for students 

within the local vicinity of Mumbai to engage in a friendly discussion ; it has since then evolved 

to a more compelling force, serving as a host to students from various disciplines, institutes 

across the nation to come together and showcase their oratory and analyzing skills.

Students are expected to engage in passionate ‘Battle of Words’, articulating a diversity of topics 

ranging from socio-economic and political trends gripping the nation to environmental issues and 

issues concerning the entire world . </p>

<p>The debate aims to provide a forum for today’s youth to put forth their views and engage in a 

dialogue on many topics that affect our lives, directly or otherwise. The quality of thoughts and 

ideas expressed by students over the past debates has been appreciated by all those who have 

witnessed the events, some of them being Former MP Priya Dutt, Mrs. Shraddha Jadhav, Mr. 

Kumar Ketkar, Ms. Mahrukh Inayet, Mr. Madhur Bhandarkar, Mr. Ashok Pandit, Mr. Mahesh 

Bhatt, Mr. Prakash Jha, Mrs. Dolly Thakore, Mr. Arnab Goswami, Mrs. Bachi Karkaria and 

other eminent personalities from the fields of Education, Social Activism and Media.

Similar to its previous years, the Father Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate will play host to 

32 teams from some of the most established institutions across the nation due to be held on the 

11th and 12th of September. </p>

</p><b>Reality is often veiled under several layers of thread made of human

perception. Like a mist, covering the hillside, the perceptions of our

minds often covers parts of the truth that is truly before us.

Now, the question arises, should we remove that mist? But it’s soothing,

it’s appeasing, it’s becalming. Is the truth more important? Or is it true

when they say “ignorance is bliss”?

Seeking answers to these questions we introduce our theme:

“Appeasing mists shrouding the hills of reality”</b></p>

<p>This year’s theme is as eloquent as it is harsh. The inspiring message here being that the reality 

as we see it is simply an illusion; that to find the true essence of truth, of light... we must delve 

deeper and embrace the darkness. Being one of the most anticipated Inter-Collegiate events in 

the literary circles of the city, a lot of effort is put into providing a platform to the youth of the 

country to put forth their views in a disciplined and rational manner through this debate. 

It is our intention to keep this tradition alive in an attempt to encourage today's youth to think 

rationally and engage themselves in the more crucial matters of the nation.</div></h3></p>
