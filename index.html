            <blockquote>
        Perhaps one of Bandra's most anticipated events, The "Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial

        Debate" ,<br/> is back with a bang in its 17th year, hosted by one of Mumbai's finest technical

        institutions,<br/> Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering.

        Inaugurated in the year 1999,<br/> the competition in its initial years served as a podium for students

        within the local vicinity of Mumbai<br/> to engage in a friendly discussion ; it has since then evolved

        to a more compelling force,<br/> serving as a host to students from various disciplines, institutes

        across the nation to come<br/> together and showcase their oratory and analyzing skills.

        Students are expected<br/> to engage in passionate ‘Battle of Words’, articulating a diversity of topics

        ranging from socio-economics<br/> and political trends gripping the nation to environmental issues and

        issues concerning<br/> the entire world. The debate aims to provide a forum<br/> for today’s youth to put forth their views and engage in a

        dialogue on many <br/>topics that affect our lives, directly or otherwise. <br/><br/>The quality of thoughts and

        ideas expressed by <br/>students over the past debates has been appreciated by all those who have

        witnessed the events,<br/> some of them being Former MP Priya Dutt, Mrs. Shraddha Jadhav, Mr.

        Kumar Ketkar, Ms. Mahrukh Inayet,<br/> Mr. Madhur Bhandarkar, Mr. Ashok Pandit, Mr. Mahesh

        Bhatt, Mr. Prakash Jha, Mrs. Dolly Thakore,<br/> Mr. Arnab Goswami, Mrs. Bachi Karkaria and

        other eminent personalities from the<br/> fields of Education, Social Activism and Media.

        Similar to its previous years,<br/> the Father Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate will play host to

        32 teams from some of the most<br/> established institutions across the nation due to be held on the

        11th and 12th of September.<br/>

        Reality is often veiled under several layers of thread made of human<br/>

        perception. Like a mist, covering the hillside, the perceptions of our<br/>

        minds often covers parts of the truth that is truly before us.<br/>

        Now, the question arises, should we remove that mist? But it’s soothing,<br/>

        it’s appeasing, it’s becalming. Is the truth more important? Or is it true<br/>

        when they say “ignorance is bliss”?

            <blockquote style="margin-left: 10px">
    <br/><br/>Seeking answers to these questions we introduce our theme:

        “Appeasing mists shrouding the hills of reality”
        <br/>
        This year’s theme is as eloquent as it is harsh. The inspiring message here being that the reality<br/>

        as we see it is simply an illusion; that to find the true essence of truth, of light... we must delve<br/>

        deeper and embrace the darkness. Being one of the most anticipated Inter-Collegiate events in<br/>

        the literary circles of the city, a lot of effort is put into providing a platform to the youth of the<br/>

        country to put forth their views in a disciplined and rational manner through this debate.<br/>

        It is our intention to keep this tradition alive in an attempt to encourage today's youth to think<br/>

        rationally and engage themselves in the more crucial matters of the nation.
